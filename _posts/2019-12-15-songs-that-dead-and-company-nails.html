And I mean this in the best way possible, when they are at their best nothing is forceful or particularly powerful, it’s just pure bliss.&nbsp; You can just close your eyes and get absolutely lost.&nbsp; I think that’s what distances them from any other <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/ByDfV0whY3UhHTmGEXq3aGMe2jdANXcjBgxRHw0/">post Jerry band</a>, no one else can do that for me.&nbsp; There’s a difference between absolutely shredding (like a lot of guitarists can) and creating that really beautiful space.</div><h3>Bird Song</h3><div><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FgHYhWgoBjM" width="560"></iframe><br />Bird Song is one of my favorite Jerry tunes,&nbsp;<a href="http://deadessays.blogspot.com/2017/03/bird-song-guest-post.html">really pretty but somber at the same time</a>.&nbsp; As is tradition, Dead and Company slows it down a good bit, but it allows them to really get out there and explore the space.&nbsp; Here's their performance from Playing in the Sand 2018 (they had another awesome performance in 2019 but I can't find a video). Hopefully we'll get another one next month!<br /><br /></div><h3>Here Comes Sunshine</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dHLnjbTc8PA" width="560"></iframe> <br />Also known as “Here Comes Salami”, these get really spacey - in a good way. I actually had a very embarrassing moment this year when I stated that I liked Dead and Company's Here Comes Sunshine more than any version I had heard by the Grateful Dead. That was, of course, a really dumb statement because I had not yet listened to the Dead's performance on&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick%27s_Picks_Volume_1">Dick's Picks 1</a>&nbsp;(12/19/73), which is just simply stellar. Amateur hour over here. Anyway, still always a great one for Dead and Company. Here's their performance from Jiffy Lube this year, my favorite from that show.<br /><br /><h3>Eyes of the World</h3><div><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdDowYZ28JQ" width="560"></iframe><br />Of course my favorite song is going to make this list! Dead and Company certainly doesn't disappoint with Eyes. The boys know how to get <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B1jsLj3B98nIfdoIarChWaGzt9ySHONPuVnCIY0/">jazzy</a>, and of course Oteil always delivers a rippin’ base solo.</div><div><br /></div><h3>Dark Star</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ik618652Gx0" width="560"></iframe> <br />Dark Star is another one that Dead and Company <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bx7xNoTh29sty0xTUK5vY0HwbAhF-D1w1luSiU0/">approaches a little differently,</a> but once you get past that, they are a lot of fun. Probably a good theme song for this blog.<br /><br /><h3>Throwing Stones</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2NXUCatascc?start=1095" width="560"></iframe><br />Bobby still gets really into Throwing Stones and has been delivering some powerful vocals recently.&nbsp; This performance is particularly emotional,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jambase.com/article/dead-company-meets-honors-stoneman-douglas-students-sunrise">played in Sunrise, FL</a>&nbsp;shortly after the tragedy at nearby Stoneman Douglas high school.<br /><div><br /></div><h3>Playing in the Band</h3><div><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eayvYUD8JLY" width="560"></iframe><br />I know what you’re gonna say - I hear this every show and I’m tired of it! Yes, I know it’s their&nbsp;<a href="https://www.setlist.fm/stats/dead-and-company-2bc42076.html">most played song</a>, but hear me out.&nbsp; When they want to, they can really stretch it out and create an awesome improvisational space out of the song.&nbsp; It never gets as spacey as some of those 30+ minute Grateful Dead versions (I think for the better, honestly, but <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Bt1s0d9BkCHvDMN7wBdsLDbNOGU76D55uGY4P00/">Donna might say otherwise</a>), but it really gets the band in a great mindset.<br /><br /><h2>Salami Specials</h2></div>Say what you want about his own music, but it’s really fun to watch John play Dead tunes.&nbsp; Here’s a few that he absolutely shines on, even though they might not showcase the rest of the band as much as others.<br /><h3>Sugaree</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mrjxT2urXaU" width="560"></iframe> <br />Nothing will ever top Jerry’s riffs on Sugaree in 77 (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick%27s_Picks_Volume_3">Dick’s Picks 3</a>&nbsp;from 5/22/77&nbsp;is my favorite) for me, but I love the way Dead and Co builds up each segment of the song.&nbsp; Mayer is always ON for this one, especially here, from one of the best shows they’ve played.<br /><br /><h3>It Hurts Me Too</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hKX8ol_TEHY" width="560"></iframe> <br />Mayer delivers some mean riffs on this blues classic (side note: Camden, NJ is not a fun place to be during a monsoon).<br /><br /><div><h3>Deal</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KgeUkoC9iRY?start=1095" width="560"></iframe> <br />Hot hot hot.&nbsp; Another one that John clearly loves to play - he's actually done it a few times at his solo shows.<br /><br /><h2>Heaters</h2>The old guys can still get after it - here’s some evidence! <br /><h3>Cumberland Blues</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/so4NRN3I_2I" width="560"></iframe> <br />They don’t always play it this fast, but it’s a lot of fun when they do! Cumberland is a great chance for Jeff to show off his stuff, and there's been some awesome interplay recently between him and John.<br /><br /><h3>Viola Lee Blues</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Fzm1O3GEko?start=1095" width="560"></iframe> <br />This is Pigpen-era dead tune that wasn't really on the map for me until hearing Dead and Company play it, and they do an amazing job. As expected, it's a bit lower energy than the early Dead versions, but once you get into the groove it's a fun one for me.<br /><br /><h3>Jack Straw</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GW4WBx3uc8" width="560"></iframe> <br />They aren’t as high energy as the rippin’ Jack Straws that we got from Jerry and Co’ in the 80’s but these still pack a punch. Beautiful interplay between John and Jeff on this quintessential Bobby/Robert Hunter song. Plus, a guest appearance by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BomaZWMhR-b01POrW1G6dVTjOCxmcoy8datZt40/">Chill Walton</a>!<br /><br /><h3>Estimated Prophet</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P-ekhdfrcek" width="560"></iframe><br />The way I like to describe seeing Estimated Prophet live is that it hits you like a freight train. Just an incredible experience.<br /><br /><h3>Hell in a Bucket</h3><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cu4ttpdLICw?start=1095" width="560"></iframe><br />It's totally different than some of the really high energy versions we got from the Grateful Dead from 1987-1990, but this incarnation is still a lot of fun.&nbsp; The slower pace allows John to get creative with his solos and the results are spectacular (this video from Lockn' 2018 is actually on the faster side for them, but&nbsp;<a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/0avyYAVAIQyZ99loV6hthc?si=wp7fOKieToyw9n5qweRJmA">here's an example</a>&nbsp;of a slower one that is still major heat).</div><div><br /></div>
