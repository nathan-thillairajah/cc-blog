View, CA) 6/1/2019</li><li><b>Knockin’ On Heaven’s Door</b> - Wrigley Field (Chicago, IL) 6/14/2019</li><li><b>Mama Tried</b> - Wrigley Field (Chicago, IL) 6/15/2019</li><li><b>Standing on the Moon</b> - Wrigley Field (Chicago, IL) 6/15/2019</li><li><b>Althea </b>- Citi Field (New York, NY) 6/23/2019</li><li><b>Jack Straw</b> - Dos Equis Pavilion (Dallas, TX) 7/2/2019</li><li><b>Cold Rain and Snow Pt. 1*</b> - Folsom Field (Boulder, CO) 7/5/2019</li><li><b>Cold Rain and Snow Pt. 2*</b> - Folsom Field (Boulder, CO) 7/5/2019</li><li><b>Estimated Prophet</b> - Folsom Field (Boulder, CO) 7/6/2019</li></ol>* interrupted by weather delay<br /><br />To start, we jump into a really tight&nbsp;<b>Big River</b>&nbsp;jam at night 2 of Shoreline.&nbsp; Then, we'll head over to&nbsp;an incredible night 1 encore at rainy Wrigley field with&nbsp;<b>Knockin'</b>.&nbsp; Moving on to night 2 at Wrigley, I've selected one of my favorite country tunes in&nbsp;<b>Mama Tried</b>, which got its first play from Dead and Company a few weeks earlier.&nbsp; Then, an emotional Bobby performance in&nbsp;<b>Standing on the Moon</b>&nbsp;in the second set.&nbsp; Next, we make our way to Queens to hear John Mayer play one of his favorite tunes on&nbsp;<a href="https://livemusicblog.com/news/jay-blakesberg-john-mayer-jerry-garcia-wolf-guitar-in-ny-background-story/">Jerry's Wolf Guitar</a>.&nbsp; I'm a little burned out on&nbsp;<b>Althea</b>&nbsp;from Dead and Company, but I think you'll really enjoy his guitar tone in this one, it just sounds fantastic.&nbsp; Next, we'll head to Texas for a beautiful&nbsp;<b>Jack Straw</b>&nbsp;and leave on the 4th of July in time to make it over to Boulder for the tour closer.&nbsp; Another weather event was the story for night 1 in Boulder, as&nbsp;<b>Cold Rain and Snow</b>&nbsp;was fittingly interrupted by a vicious storm.&nbsp; When the sky cleared 90 minutes later, they jumped right back in and finished it, before jumping into&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jambase.com/article/dead-company-weather-rain-delay-boulder">quite possibly the longest set they've played</a>&nbsp;in order to squeeze the whole setlist in before curfew.&nbsp; And finally, we'll close with a powerful&nbsp;<b>Estimated Prophet</b>&nbsp;on night 2.<br /><br />Before you yell at me, two notes about Nathan's Picks:<br /><ol><li>With each volume of Nathan's Picks, I've limited myself to what will fit on an 80 minute CD, which is why you only see 8 songs here.&nbsp; It honestly feels criminal to try to whittle the tour down to a short list like this, so I apologize if I offended you.</li><br /><li>After some soul searching, I've decided to continue of the tradition of slotting performances in chronological order, which makes for some interesting setlist ordering.</li></ol><div>Enjoy! And please let me know about any glaring omissions in the comment section!</div><div><h4 style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hhZ5LbfRQqg0Z_6HWdtISDBSmJdFm48R">Download (MP3)</a></h4></div>
