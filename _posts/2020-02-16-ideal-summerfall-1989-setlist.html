Let’s get back into the Brent Era with an ideal setlist from 1989.&nbsp; If you’re new to the ideal setlist series, I compile a bunch of my favorite performances from a particular year/era, into what I would consider to be a “dream” setlist if I were attending a show on a given night within the time period.&nbsp; Similar to my other ideal setlists, these selections are definitely geared towards the more accessible shows (on Spotify and Youtube), so please leave heaters that I’ve missed in the comments.<br /><br />Thanks to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lotmart/">@lotmart</a> for inspiring me with these crispy ‘89 memes (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BpZ5dl_h32xoinlwI4wfag8VOwQQYTLo7pKaAk0/">Berndawg</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B8MtgKAhHYDuNMn7Z5crpA9kt6DfGtYb0vKgvA0/">Randy Bobandy</a>).<br /><br />We’ll start with the funky <b>Shakedown</b> that they opened with at Giants Stadium on July 9th, 1989, and stay right there for a rippin’ <b>Jack Straw</b> and a juicy <b>West LA Fadeaway</b>.&nbsp; After being featured on this year’s box set release, 7/9/89 has quickly become one of my favorite shows.&nbsp; Treat yourself to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j6A5-26YOs">video experience for these</a>, the energy onstage is just unreal.&nbsp; My <a href="https://youtu.be/_j6A5-26YOs?t=983">favorite moment</a> is when Bobby is finishing his verse in the middle of Jack Straw, Jerry just gives a look back at the drummers, as if to say “ok, we’re doing this”.&nbsp; And he proceeds to launch into a high powered solo, building up with Brent, and peaking in a thunderous final chorus.&nbsp; Really just gives you goosebumps watching them kick it into another gear like that, I can’t even begin to imagine what it would have been like to be at either of those Giants Stadium shows.&nbsp; As Grateful Dead archivist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4aoY5DILk">Dave Lemeuix describes</a>, “there was something juiced about that place… they were able to make this concrete structure - 66,000 seats - into something intimate”.&nbsp; Truly a band beyond description.<br /><br /><b>Built to Last</b> is next from one of the unbelievable <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B76tHuDh6xex6rZ-mhWRv4cMJ9xYrzsi_9F4bE0/">Alpine Valley shows</a> on 7/17/89.&nbsp; Really an underrated song for me, and they were just ON this night.&nbsp; Now we’ll go back in time 10 days to 7/7/89 at JFK stadium to hear an awesome Bob Dylan song in <b>Stuck Inside of Mobile with the Memphis Blues Again</b>.<br /><br />Strap up my friends, we’re headed to <a href="https://www.hamptoncoliseum.org/">the MOTHERSHIP</a> to another stellar Dylan cover - <b>Queen Jane Approximately</b> - on 10/8/89.&nbsp; Bobby does an incredible job of singing these songs in an authentic way, and this version features some especially sublime work from Jerry and Brent.&nbsp; There really have been some incredible moments in this venue, for both the Dead and Phish.&nbsp; Let’s pop over to Meadowlands Arena for a deliciously weird<b> Let It Grow</b> on 10/16/89 (what the heck is that effect on Jerry’s guitar in the middle??) and finally, we’ll close the first set by coming back to JFK Stadium on 7/7/89 to for&nbsp;<b>Blow Away</b>.&nbsp; &nbsp;Truly a rousing performance from Brent - that dude straight up poured his heart and soul into these songs and Blow Away really gave him a chance to shine.<br /><div><br /></div><div><div>To open the 2nd set, we’ll return to JFK Stadium for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMpaD-ktv7Q">hottest <b>Iko Iko</b> I’ve ever heard</a>.&nbsp; You can tell that Jerry loves playing this song and the interplay with Brent is so much fun.&nbsp; (I know it was played in the first set at this particular show, but I’m taking some creative liberties here as it was sometimes a 2nd set song.)&nbsp; We’ll continue with a relatively concise <b>Playing in the Band</b> into a really nice <b>Uncle John’s Band</b> at the second Giants Stadium show on 7/10.</div><div><br /></div><div>Find your seat in the Mothership for a totally spacey <b>Rhythm Devils</b>/<b>Space</b>, and we’ll depart on a journey to our favorite lunar mass (or stage the landing, whatever you’re into) to hear a really gorgeous version of <b>Standing on the Moon</b> on 7/7/89.&nbsp; After we come back down to Earth, we’ll hear Brent shine on Traffic’s <b>Dear Mr. Fantasy</b> into the crowd favorite <b>Hey Jude</b> at Alpine Valley (7/18).&nbsp; The <b>Not Fade Away</b> from (7/4/89) will close out the set for us - yet another one that deserves <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkY6ZOx411g">the video treatment</a>, the Jerry/Brent connection is goosebump-inducing.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>For the encore, we’ll get all up in our feels with <b>And We Bid You Goodnight</b> from the 7/17 Alpine Valley show of the summer, and head back to October to finish the show with <b>Black Muddy River</b>.&nbsp; Something something something I don't like to be the guy that complains but would love to hear this more from Dead and Company instead of Ripple :)</div></div><div><br /></div><div><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Set 1</span></b></div><div><span style="font-size: large;">Shakedown Street &gt;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">Jack Straw &gt;</span><br /><span style="font-size: large;">West L.A.
